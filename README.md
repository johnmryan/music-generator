A music generator based on Markov models, both in web app JavaScript/HTML/CSS and in Python.
Check it out in action [here](http://johnmryan.github.io/music-generator)!

In order to use this program, just type in a string of notes (Middle C through B) as outlined in the example for Mary Had a Little Lamb.
To generate songs of first and second order, select the radio button according to your choice and click 'Generate!'. On click of the play button,
the tune will play (it is a bit loud so keep your volume low).

The music generator can also be run from the terminal in Python, though it will only be able to generate the output, not play the notes aloud.
